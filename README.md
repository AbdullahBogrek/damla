## General Information

- Nowadays, people try to communicate with people and ask for help through social media. They try to do this using social media celebrities or popular trends. While some are successful, most cannot reach enough people. However, someone try to defraud people and make money by exploiting their emotions. Considering these problems, it is aimed to develop a location-based environment with a safe, simple, and lean interface.    

- Users can create requests at any time after registration. To create a request, request information, user information, and address information must be entered. After this process is completed, the address information is converted into coordinate information with the **Geocoding API**. With this coordinate information, the request is marked on the map using the **Maps Javascript API**. This process is the same for creating opportunities.

## Prerequisites

- Have a billing account on [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/getting-started?hl=tr).

- Create a project on [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/getting-started?hl=tr) and add **Maps JavaScript API** and **Geocoding API**. Get the access token.
